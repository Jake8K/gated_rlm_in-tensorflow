No , Time , thou shalt not boast that I do change
Thy pyramids built up with newer might
To me are nothing novel , nothing strange
They are but dressings of a former sight
Our dates are brief , and therefore we admire
What thou dost foist upon us that is old ,
And rather make them born to our desire
Than think that we before have heard them told
Thy registers and thee I both defy ,
Not wondering at the present nor the past ,
For thy records and what we see doth lie ,
Made more or less by thy continual haste
This I do vow and this shall ever be
I will be true , despite thy scythe and thee

A woman 's face with Nature 's own hand painted
Hast thou , the master mistress of my passion
A woman 's gentle heart , but not acquainted
With shifting change , as is false women 's fashion
An eye more bright than theirs , less false in rolling ,
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth
A man in hue , all 'hues' in his controlling ,
Much steals men 's eyes and women 's souls amazeth
And for a woman wert thou first created
Till Nature , as she wrought thee , fell a doting ,
And by addition me of thee defeated ,
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing
But since she prick 'd thee out for women 's pleasure ,
Mine be thy love and thy love 's use their treasure

O thou , my lovely boy , who in thy power
Dost hold Time 's fickle glass , his sickle , hour
Who hast by waning grown , and therein show 'st
Thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow 'st
If Nature , sovereign mistress over wrack ,
As thou goest onwards , still will pluck thee back ,
She keeps thee to this purpose , that her skill
May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill
Yet fear her , O thou minion of her pleasure !
She may detain , but not still keep , her treasure
Her audit , though delay 'd , answer 'd must be ,
And her quietus is to render thee

Thou art as tyrannous , so as thou art ,
As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel
For well thou know 'st to my dear doting heart
Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel
Yet , in good faith , some say that thee behold
Thy face hath not the power to make love groan
To say they err I dare not be so bold ,
Although I swear it to myself alone
And , to be sure that is not false I swear ,
A thousand groans , but thinking on thy face ,
One on another 's neck , do witness bear
Thy black is fairest in my judgment 's place
In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds ,
And thence this slander , as I think , proceeds

Thine eyes I love , and they , as pitying me ,
Knowing thy heart torments me with disdain ,
Have put on black and loving mourners be ,
Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain
And truly not the morning sun of heaven
Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east ,
Nor that full star that ushers in the even
Doth half that glory to the sober west ,
As those two mourning eyes become thy face
O , let it then as well beseem thy heart
To mourn for me , since mourning doth thee grace ,
And suit thy pity like in every part
Then will I swear beauty herself is black
And all they foul that thy complexion lack

Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me !
Is't not enough to torture me alone ,
But slave to slavery my sweet 'st friend must be ?
Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken ,
And my next self thou harder hast engross 'd
Of him , myself , and thee , I am forsaken
A torment thrice threefold thus to be cross 'd
Prison my heart in thy steel bosom 's ward ,
But then my friend 's heart let my poor heart bail
Whoe'er keeps me , let my heart be his guard
Thou canst not then use rigor in my gaol
And yet thou wilt for I , being pent in thee ,
Perforce am thine , and all that is in me

So , now I have confess 'd that he is thine ,
And I myself am mortgaged to thy will ,
Myself I 'll forfeit , so that other mine
Thou wilt restore , to be my comfort still
But thou wilt not , nor he will not be free ,
For thou art covetous and he is kind
He learn 'd but surety like to write for me
Under that bond that him as fast doth bind
The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take ,
Thou usurer , that put 'st forth all to use ,
And sue a friend came debtor for my sake
So him I lose through my unkind abuse
Him have I lost thou hast both him and me
He pays the whole , and yet am I not free

O , call not me to justify the wrong
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue
Use power with power and slay me not by art
Tell me thou lovest elsewhere , but in my sight ,
Dear heart , forbear to glance thine eye aside
What need 'st thou wound with cunning when thy might
Is more than my o'er press 'd defense can bide ?
Let me excuse thee ah ! my love well knows
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies ,
And therefore from my face she turns my foes ,
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries
Yet do not so but since I am near slain ,
Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain

Be wise as thou art cruel do not press
My tongue tied patience with too much disdain
Lest sorrow lend me words and words express
The manner of my pity wanting pain
If I might teach thee wit , better it were ,
Though not to love , yet , love , to tell me so
As testy sick men , when their deaths be near ,
No news but health from their physicians know
For if I should despair , I should grow mad ,
And in my madness might speak ill of thee
Now this ill wresting world is grown so bad ,
Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be ,
That I may not be so , nor thou belied ,
Bear thine eyes straight , though thy proud heart go wide

In faith , I do not love thee with mine eyes ,
For they in thee a thousand errors note
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise ,
Who in despite of view is pleased to dote
Nor are mine ears with thy tongue 's tune delighted ,
Nor tender feeling , to base touches prone ,
Nor taste , nor smell , desire to be invited
To any sensual feast with thee alone
But my five wits nor my five senses can
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee ,
Who leaves unsway 'd the likeness of a man ,
Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be
Only my plague thus far I count my gain ,
That she that makes me sin awards me pain

Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate ,
Hate of my sin , grounded on sinful loving
O , but with mine compare thou thine own state ,
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving
Or , if it do , not from those lips of thine ,
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments
And seal 'd false bonds of love as oft as mine ,
Robb 'd others' beds' revenues of their rents
Be it lawful I love thee , as thou lovest those
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee
Root pity in thy heart , that when it grows
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be
If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide ,
By self example mayst thou be denied !

Those lips that Love 's own hand did make
Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate'
To me that languish 'd for her sake
But when she saw my woeful state ,
Straight in her heart did mercy come ,
Chiding that tongue that ever sweet
Was used in giving gentle doom ,
And taught it thus anew to greet
'I hate' she alter 'd with an end ,
That follow 'd it as gentle day
Doth follow night , who like a fiend
From heaven to hell is flown away
'I hate' from hate away she threw ,
And saved my life , saying 'not you '

My love is as a fever , longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease ,
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill ,
The uncertain sickly appetite to please
My reason , the physician to my love ,
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept ,
Hath left me , and I desperate now approve
Desire is death , which physic did except
Past cure I am , now reason is past care ,
And frantic mad with evermore unrest
My thoughts and my discourse as madmen 's are ,
At random from the truth vainly express 'd
For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright ,
Who art as black as hell , as dark as night

O me , what eyes hath Love put in my head ,
Which have no correspondence with true sight !
Or , if they have , where is my judgment fled ,
That censures falsely what they see aright ?
If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote ,
What means the world to say it is not so ?
If it be not , then love doth well denote
Love 's eye is not so true as all men 's 'No '
How can it ? O , how can Love 's eye be true ,
That is so vex 'd with watching and with tears ?
No marvel then , though I mistake my view
The sun itself sees not till heaven clears
O cunning Love ! with tears thou keep 'st me blind ,
Lest eyes well seeing thy foul faults should find

Canst thou , O cruel ! say I love thee not ,
When I against myself with thee partake ?
Do I not think on thee , when I forgot
Am of myself , all tyrant , for thy sake ?
Who hateth thee that I do call my friend ?
On whom frown 'st thou that I do fawn upon ?
Nay , if thou lour 'st on me , do I not spend
Revenge upon myself with present moan ?
What merit do I in myself respect ,
That is so proud thy service to despise ,
When all my best doth worship thy defect ,
Commanded by the motion of thine eyes ?
But , love , hate on , for now I know thy mind
Those that can see thou lovest , and I am blind
